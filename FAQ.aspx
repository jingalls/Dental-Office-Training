    <p class="FAQQuestion">
        <strong>Q.</strong> What is hands-on-training?</p>
    <p class="FAQAnswer">
        <strong>A.</strong> Hands-on training means you learn chairside assisting with the
        dentist,laboratory duties (i.e.) making impressions, pouring models, making bleach
        trays, and preparing the cases for the lab. My facility has two fully operational
        dental operatories. We start working in these operatories day 1. I also have 5 computer
        stations that we start working on day 1. Limited enrollment is necessary because
        I feel that it so important for each student to maximize his/her training, working
        with the equipment and learning about the materials by actually using them daily.</p>
    <p class="FAQQuestion">
        <strong>Q.</strong> Why is learning dental software important?</p>
    <p class="FAQAnswer">
        <strong>A.</strong> You also learn two different dental softwares. This sets my
        program apart from any other that you may come across.The computer skills and knowledge
        that you obtain during this program applies to front office administration and hands
        on chairside charting with the dentist in the operatories. Learning how to effectively
        check patients in and out and file their insurance claim, along with properly charting
        for the dentist chair side are invaluable to your employer. Your learning will involve
        ALL areas of the office, which makes you a VALUABLE employee. Dentists are hiring
        employees that have the skills and knowledge that they think are important. This
        is definitely an area that will set you apart from any other applicant for the same
        job. Knowing the dentists software BEFORE you are hired is a tremendous bonus. I've
        had dentists say that this aspect of my training is worth the tuition alone!! Dentists
        don't have to lose any production time training a new employee on their software,
        it's done before you are hired.

    <p class="FAQQuestion">
        <strong>Q.</strong> Are there jobs available?</p>
    <p class="FAQAnswer">
        <strong>A.</strong> The Department of Labor states that between the years 2004-2014,
        dental assisting is projected to be one the fastest growing occupation. Dental assisting
        is a great family-oriented career. Most dentists work a 32-hour workweek and have
        weekends and holidays off. This is a career that you can use as a stepping stone
        to higher paying occupations. The opportunity is always available to climb higher,
        once you learn the basic skills. People are living longer and maintaining their
        teeth longer, too! This creates job security and promotes dental assisting to be
        one of the most secure jobs of all.

    <p class="FAQQuestion">
        <strong>Q.</strong> Is this program &quot;accredited?&quot;</p>
    <p class="FAQAnswer">
        <strong>A.</strong> This program is accredited through the Indiana Commission on
        Propietary Education. So, yes it is accredited through the state. It is not a dental
        certified program. However, after interviewing many dentists concerning this issue,
        it is clear that many dentists are not concerned with their employees being certified.
        They are much more concerned with them knowing the skills and learning what the
        dentist thinks is important, rather than what a curriculum has taught for the last
        25-30 years. Dentistry has changed by leaps and bounds over that last few decades,
        and this program is designed to teach you everything you need to know for &quot;today's&quot;
        dentistry. You will be highly trained in ALL areas of the dental office.</p>

        all my students to become certified in radiology.Upon graduation of class, you are
        eligible to take your radiology certification test. My program is accreditated through
        the Indiana State Department of Health for radiology.</p>
    <p class="FAQQuestion">
        <strong>Q.</strong> What do I receive after completing this course?</p>

        you will create, and build your resumes in class.The last few weeks of the program
        you will go out and job shadow and do some assisting in a variety of offices. This
        gives you an opportunity to meet dentists, hand out your resumes, and obtain interviews
        and possible employment before you even graduate.</p>
